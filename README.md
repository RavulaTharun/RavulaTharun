## About Me

I am an AI Engineer specializing in **Generative AI, RAG systems, and Agentic AI workflows**, with over three years of experience building and deploying production-grade AI systems. I work across the entire pipeline-data ingestion, embedding architectures, retrieval optimization, LLM integration, agent workflows, and full LLMOps deployment on AWS and GCP.

My focus is on building **high-reliability, scalable, and low-latency AI services** that solve real business problems. I consistently deliver measurable improvements in retrieval quality, latency, system throughput, and operational reliability through careful system design and optimization.

I am currently working on projects involving **multi-agent architectures, vector search scaling, and enterprise-grade RAG pipelines**.

I am open to full-time, contract, and freelance work in **AI Engineering, LLMOps, and Applied Generative AI**.
